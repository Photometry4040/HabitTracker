# 🎯 Final Verification Checklist

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Purpose**: Verify complete system deployment after Phase 3

---

## ✅ Deployment Verification (Complete)

- [x] Edge Function deployed to Supabase
- [x] Edge Function URL accessible
- [x] CORS headers configured correctly
- [x] Database schema verified
- [x] NEW SCHEMA tables accessible
- [x] OLD SCHEMA archived (habit_tracker_old)
- [x] Monitoring view created (v_old_schema_status)

---

## 🧪 Functional Testing (To Do)

### 1. Authentication
- [ ] User can login with email/password
- [ ] Session persists after page reload
- [ ] Logout works correctly

### 2. Child Management
- [ ] Create new child
- [ ] View child list
- [ ] Select child
- [ ] Delete child (uses Edge Function)

### 3. Habit Tracking
- [ ] Select week start date (auto-adjusts to Monday)
- [ ] Click habit buttons (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Toggle off colors (click same color again)
- [ ] Fill in reflection fields
- [ ] Enter reward text

### 4. Data Persistence (Critical)
- [ ] Click Save button
- [ ] See success message
- [ ] Reload page
- [ ] Data still present
- [ ] Run verification: `node scripts/check-latest-save.js`

### 5. Edge Function Verification
After saving data, check:

```bash
# Run verification script
node scripts/verify-new-schema-only.js
```

Expected output:
- ✅ Operation logged in idempotency_log
- ✅ schema_version = "new_only"
- ✅ Data in NEW SCHEMA (weeks, habits, habit_records)
- ✅ NO data in OLD SCHEMA

### 6. Dashboard
- [ ] Switch to Dashboard view
- [ ] See statistics (if data exists)
- [ ] Charts render correctly
- [ ] Export to Excel works

---

## 🔍 Database Verification

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Check NEW SCHEMA data
SELECT
  c.name as child_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT w.id) as weeks_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT h.id) as habits_count,
  COUNT(hr.id) as records_count
FROM children c
LEFT JOIN weeks w ON w.child_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN habits h ON h.week_id = w.id
LEFT JOIN habit_records hr ON hr.habit_id = h.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;

-- 2. Check idempotency log (should show new_only)
SELECT
  operation,
  response_data->>'schema_version' as schema_version,
  status,
  created_at
FROM idempotency_log
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. Verify OLD SCHEMA unchanged
SELECT * FROM v_old_schema_status;
-- record_count should remain 34
```
