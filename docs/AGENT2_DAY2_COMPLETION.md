# Agent 2: Statistics Engineer - Day 2 Completion Report

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Agent:** Statistics Engineer (Agent 2)
**Task:** Day 2 - Create Recharts Components and Integrate Weekly Statistics

---

## Summary

Successfully completed Day 2 tasks by creating two Recharts components for visualizing weekly habit statistics and integrating them into the Dashboard with proper React Query setup.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Chart Components Created

#### `/src/components/charts/WeeklyBarChart.jsx`
- **Purpose:** Display daily habit completion as a bar chart
- **Features:**
  - X-axis: Days of week (월, 화, 수, 목, 금, 토, 일)
  - Y-axis: Number of completed habits
  - Color-coded bars based on success rate:
    - Green: >80% success rate
    - Yellow: 50-80% success rate
    - Red: <50% success rate
  - Custom tooltip showing completion details
  - Rounded bar corners for modern UI
  - Fully responsive

#### `/src/components/charts/SuccessRateDonut.jsx`
- **Purpose:** Display success rate distribution as a donut chart
- **Features:**
  - Donut segments for Green (잘했어요), Yellow (보통), Red (아쉬워요)
  - Center text showing overall success rate percentage
  - Custom tooltip with emoji and percentages
  - Custom legend with emoji indicators
  - Percentage labels inside donut segments
  - Empty state when no data available
  - Fully responsive

### 2. Dashboard Integration

#### Updated `/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`
- Added `useWeekStats` hook integration
- Added new "주간 통계" section with:
  - Side-by-side layout (responsive: stacks on mobile)
  - WeeklyBarChart showing daily completion
  - SuccessRateDonut showing success distribution
  - Loading states with spinner
  - Error states with warning icon
  - Statistics summary cards showing:
    - Best day of the week
    - Streak (consecutive days above 70%)
    - Total habits count
    - Total records count

#### Updated `/Users/jueunlee/project/Habit Tracker Template for Kids with Visual Goals/App.jsx`
- Added `weekStartDate` prop to Dashboard component
- Ensures proper data flow for statistics queries

### 3. React Query Setup

#### Updated `/src/main.jsx`
- Installed `@tanstack/react-query@^5.90.2`
- Created QueryClient with sensible defaults:
  - Stale time: 5 minutes
  - Cache time: 10 minutes
  - Retry: 2 attempts
  - Disabled refetch on window focus (for better UX)
- Wrapped App with QueryClientProvider

### 4. Migration Documentation

#### Updated `supabase/migrations/20251014_stats_weekly.sql`
- Added comprehensive refresh strategy notes:
  - Automatic refresh with pg_cron (recommended for production)
  - Manual refresh for development
  - Trigger-based option for real-time updates
- Added performance considerations
- Documented current state and production recommendations

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture

```
Dashboard.jsx
├── useWeekStats() hook (React Query)
│   └── Fetches data from calculateWeekStats() in statistics.js
├── 주간 통계 Card
│   ├── WeeklyBarChart (7-day completion bars)
│   ├── SuccessRateDonut (color distribution)
│   └── Statistics Summary (4 metric cards)
└── Existing dashboard components (unchanged)
```

### Data Flow

```
1. User selects child + week in App.jsx
   ↓
2. Dashboard receives childName + weekStartDate props
   ↓
3. useWeekStats() hook queries the database
   ↓
4. statistics.js calculates comprehensive stats
   ↓
5. React Query caches result (5 min stale time)
   ↓
6. Charts render with cached/fresh data
```

### Responsive Design

- **Desktop (lg+):** Side-by-side chart layout (2 columns)
- **Tablet (md):** Side-by-side chart layout (2 columns)
- **Mobile (<md):** Stacked chart layout (1 column)
- **Summary cards:** 2 columns on mobile, 4 columns on desktop

### Color System

All charts use the consistent color palette:
- Green: `#10B981` (green-500) - Success
- Yellow: `#F59E0B` (yellow-500) - Partial success
- Red: `#EF4444` (red-500) - Needs improvement
- Purple: `#8B5CF6` (purple-600) - Primary theme
- Gray: Various shades for text and borders

   - `/src/components/charts/WeeklyBarChart.jsx` (88 lines)
   - `/src/components/charts/SuccessRateDonut.jsx` (146 lines)
   - `/docs/AGENT2_DAY2_COMPLETION.md` (this file)

2. **Modified:**

## Testing Results

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
- ✅ Build successful (748 KB JS, 33 KB CSS)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No ESLint errors
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly

### Integration Points
- ✅ Dashboard accepts weekStartDate prop
- ✅ useWeekStats hook properly configured
- ✅ React Query provider wraps app
- ✅ Charts render with proper data structure
- ✅ Loading/error states implemented
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind classes

---

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.90.2"
}
```

**Already available:**
- `recharts@^3.1.0` (used for charts)
- `lucide-react@^0.263.1` (used for icons)
- `tailwindcss@^3.3.3` (used for styling)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Materialized View Refresh:**
   - Currently requires manual refresh after data changes
   - Production deployment should add pg_cron scheduling
   - See migration file for implementation details

2. **React Query Cache:**
   - 5-minute stale time means recent changes may not appear immediately
   - Users can refresh the page to force refetch
   - Consider adding a "Refresh Statistics" button in future

3. **Chart Responsiveness:**
   - Charts use fixed height (300px)
   - Works well on all screen sizes but could be optimized for very small screens (<360px)

---

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope for Day 2)

1. **Chart Interactivity:**
   - Click on bar to see detailed habit breakdown for that day
   - Click on donut segment to filter habits by color
   - Export chart as image

2. **Advanced Visualizations:**
   - Line chart showing trend over multiple weeks
   - Heatmap showing best/worst times of day
   - Comparison chart between different children

3. **Performance:**
   - Virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Lazy loading of charts
   - Progressive loading with skeleton screens

4. **Accessibility:**
   - ARIA labels for screen readers
   - Keyboard navigation for chart interactions
   - High contrast mode

## Handoff Notes for Next Agent

### If continuing with Agent 2 (Day 3):
- Monthly statistics implementation can now follow the same pattern
- Consider adding month view selector to Dashboard
- Implement useMonthStats hook usage (already exists in hooks)

### If handing off to other agents:
- Weekly statistics foundation is complete
- Dashboard.jsx has a clean section for "주간 통계" - don't modify
- React Query is now available for all async data fetching
- Chart components are reusable - consider using for other features
