# Phase 5.3: Advanced Reward Triggers

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Development Complete** (Pending DB Migration)
**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Dependencies**: Phase 5.1 (Reward System), Phase 5.2 (Weekly Planner)

---

## üìã Overview

Phase 5.3 extends the reward system with 4 new advanced trigger types to enhance user motivation and engagement across different time horizons and achievement types.

**New Triggers Added:**
1. `streak_21` - 21-day habit streak (habit formation milestone)
2. `first_weakness_resolved` - First weakness overcome
3. `habit_mastery` - 30 consecutive green days (true mastery)
4. `weekly_planner_perfect` - 100% weekly plan completion

---

## üéØ Design Rationale

### 1. `streak_21` - 21-Day Streak Badge
**Scientific Basis**: Based on the "21-day rule" for habit formation
**Reward Type**: Badge
**Trigger**: User completes same habit for 21 consecutive days

**Why 21 days?**
- Popularized by Dr. Maxwell Maltz's research on habit formation
- Provides medium-term milestone between streak_14 and habit_mastery
- Reinforces emerging habits before they're fully automatic

**Implementation**:
```javascript
checkStreak21(childName, habitId, streakDays)
```

---

### 2. `first_weakness_resolved` - Overcoming Badge
**Psychological Basis**: First success creates powerful motivation
**Reward Type**: Badge
**Trigger**: User resolves their first weakness entry

**Why this matters:**
- First victories are psychologically significant
- Builds confidence for tackling future challenges
- Celebrates the courage to identify and address weaknesses

**Implementation**:
```javascript
checkFirstWeaknessResolved(childName)
```

---

### 3. `habit_mastery` - Master Achievement
**Mastery Threshold**: 30 consecutive green days
**Reward Type**: Achievement
**Trigger**: Single habit maintained at "green" level for 30 days

**Why 30 days?**
- Exceeds typical habit formation period
- Demonstrates true commitment and consistency
- Higher bar than streak_21 for exceptional performance

**Implementation**:
```javascript
checkHabitMastery(childName, habitId, greenDays)
```

---

### 4. `weekly_planner_perfect` - Perfect Week Sticker
**Integration Point**: Phase 5.2 Weekly Planner
**Reward Type**: Sticker
**Trigger**: Weekly plan completed at 100% completion rate

**Why this matters:**
- Bridges Learning Mode and Weekly Planner features
- Rewards planning + execution (not just tracking)
- Creates positive feedback loop for using planner

**Implementation**:
```javascript
checkWeeklyPlannerPerfect(childName, weeklyPlanId, completionRate)
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

**Migration**: `20251027_012_phase5_advanced_reward_triggers.sql`

#### Step 1: Update `reward_definitions` CHECK Constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE reward_definitions
ADD CONSTRAINT reward_definitions_trigger_event_check CHECK (trigger_event IN (
  -- Í∏∞Ï°¥ 9Í∞ú Ìä∏Î¶¨Í±∞
  'goal_completed', 'weakness_resolved', 'retry_success',
  'streak_3', 'streak_7', 'streak_14',
  'first_goal', 'first_mandala', 'perfect_week',

  -- Ïã†Í∑ú 4Í∞ú Ìä∏Î¶¨Í±∞
  'streak_21', 'first_weakness_resolved',
  'habit_mastery', 'weekly_planner_perfect'
));
```

#### Step 2: Update `progress_events` CHECK Constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE progress_events
ADD CONSTRAINT progress_events_event_type_check CHECK (event_type IN (
  -- ÎèôÏùºÌïú 13Í∞ú Ïù¥Î≤§Ìä∏ ÌÉÄÏûÖ
));
```

#### Step 3: Insert Default Reward Definitions
```sql
-- 4Í∞ú Í∏∞Î≥∏ Î≥¥ÏÉÅ Ï†ïÏùò ÏûêÎèô ÏÉùÏÑ±
-- (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHINGÏúºÎ°ú ÏïàÏ†ÑÌïòÍ≤å Ïû¨Ïã§Ìñâ Í∞ÄÎä•)
```

### API Functions (`src/lib/learning-mode.js`)

#### 1. `checkStreak21(childName, habitId, streakDays)`
**Purpose**: Detect and record 21-day streak achievement

**Logic**:
1. Verify `streakDays >= 21`
2. Check if already recorded for this habit
3. Record new `streak_21` progress event
4. Return event or null

**Duplicate Prevention**: Checks `payload->>habit_id` in existing events

---

#### 2. `checkHabitMastery(childName, habitId, greenDays)`
**Purpose**: Detect and record 30-day green mastery

**Logic**:
1. Verify `greenDays >= 30`
2. Check if already recorded for this habit
3. Record new `habit_mastery` progress event
4. Return event or null

**Duplicate Prevention**: Checks `payload->>habit_id` in existing events

---

#### 3. `checkWeeklyPlannerPerfect(childName, weeklyPlanId, completionRate)`
**Purpose**: Detect and record 100% weekly plan completion

**Logic**:
1. Verify `completionRate === 100`
2. Check if already recorded for this plan
3. Record new `weekly_planner_perfect` progress event
4. Return event or null

**Duplicate Prevention**: Checks `payload->>weekly_plan_id` in existing events

---

#### 4. `checkFirstWeaknessResolved(childName)`
**Purpose**: Detect and record first weakness resolution

**Logic**:
1. Count resolved weaknesses for child
2. Trigger only if count === 1 (first resolution)
3. Check if already recorded
4. Record new `first_weakness_resolved` progress event
5. Return event or null

**Duplicate Prevention**: Checks `event_type` + `child_id` combination

---

## üîó Integration Points

### Where to Call These Functions

#### 1. `checkStreak21` & `checkHabitMastery`
**Location**: Habit record update handler (App.jsx or dual-write.js)

**Trigger Point**: After updating `habit_records` table

**Pseudo-code**:
```javascript
// After saving habit record
const streakDays = calculateCurrentStreak(habitId)
const greenDays = calculateConsecutiveGreenDays(habitId)

await checkStreak21(childName, habitId, streakDays)
await checkHabitMastery(childName, habitId, greenDays)
```

---

#### 2. `checkWeeklyPlannerPerfect`
**Location**: WeeklyPlannerManager.jsx completion handler

**Trigger Point**: When user marks weekly plan as completed

**Pseudo-code**:
```javascript
// In completeWeeklyPlan function
const stats = await getWeeklyPlanProgress(weeklyPlanId)
if (stats.completion_rate === 100) {
  await checkWeeklyPlannerPerfect(childName, weeklyPlanId, 100)
}
```

---

#### 3. `checkFirstWeaknessResolved`
**Location**: WeaknessLogger.jsx resolve handler

**Trigger Point**: After marking weakness as "resolved"

**Pseudo-code**:
```javascript
// After updating weakness status to 'resolved'
await checkFirstWeaknessResolved(childName)
```

---

## üìä Expected Payload Formats

### `streak_21` Event
```json
{
  "habit_id": "uuid",
  "streak_count": 21
}
```

### `habit_mastery` Event
```json
{
  "habit_id": "uuid",
  "green_days": 30

## üìà Metrics to Track

After deployment, monitor:

1. **Trigger Frequency**:
   - How often is each new trigger activated?
   - Which triggers are most/least common?

2. **User Engagement**:
   - Does `weekly_planner_perfect` increase planner usage?
   - Does `streak_21` improve habit consistency?

3. **Completion Rates**:
   - What % of users reach `habit_mastery` (30 days)?
   - What % resolve their first weakness?

4. **Reward Distribution**:
   - Are rewards balanced across trigger types?
   - Any triggers too easy/hard to achieve?

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Apply Migration (Manual)
```bash
# Copy migration SQL to Supabase SQL Editor
# Execute migration
# Verify with:
SELECT name, trigger_event, description
FROM reward_definitions
WHERE trigger_event IN (
  'streak_21', 'first_weakness_resolved',
  'habit_mastery', 'weekly_planner_perfect'
);
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Phase 5.3 advanced reward triggers"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Integrate Trigger Checks
- Add calls to `check*` functions in appropriate handlers
- Test in development environment
- Deploy to production

### 4. Monitor & Iterate
- Check `progress_events` table for new event types
- Monitor `rewards_ledger` for reward issuance
- Adjust trigger thresholds if needed

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional Triggers
1. `streak_100` - Centenarian badge (100-day streak)
2. `all_habits_green` - Perfect day (all habits green)
3. `weekly_improvement` - Week-over-week progress
4. `goal_tree_complete` - Complete goal hierarchy
5. `mandala_81_complete` - Fill entire 81-cell mandala

### Trigger Customization
- Allow parents to define custom trigger thresholds
- Per-child reward preferences (badges vs stickers)
- Age-appropriate trigger difficulty

### Gamification
- Reward tiers (bronze/silver/gold for streaks)
- Combo rewards (multiple triggers in one week)
- Seasonal/special event rewards
